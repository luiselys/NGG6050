        "A confidence interval quantifies a range of potential values that a parameter of a population (e.g., its mean value) can take, based on sampled observations (i.e., the data you have). In other words, the confidence interval is a measure of uncertainty: the wider the interval, the more uncertainty there is on the actual value of the parameter, given the data. Confidence intervals are a foundational piece of all rigorous, quantitative analyses of data and in fact have been proposed to be one of the three pillars of \"[the new statistics](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797613504966)\" (the other two being measures of effect sizes and the use of meta-analyses).\n",

        "Exactly how confidence intervals should be interpreted is a matter of [debate](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/2272/whats-the-difference-between-a-confidence-interval-and-a-credible-interval) and depends (of course!) on whether it was computed using frequentist or Bayesian methods. In either case, they are computed at a pre-specified confidence level, which is typically 95% but can be other values (e.g., 90% or 99%).\n",
        "\n",
        "Using Bayesian methods, the interval (typically referred to as a \"credible interval\") is interpreted in a more intuitive manner: there is a 95% (or whatever value that is specified by the confidence level) chance that the true value is within the given interval (more specifically, 95% of the mass of the posterior probability distribution is within the given interval).\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, a frequentist confidence interval implies that if we repeated the same experiment N times, the true value will fall within that interval 95% of the time.\n",
        "\n",
        "The good news is that under a number of common conditions, the two approaches give very similar answers and so as a practical matter it might not matter very much which you use (e.g., [this paper](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1358934/files/folder/Courses/Quantitative%20Neuro%20Core/Readings/Confidence%20Intervals%20and%20Bootstrapping/Confidence%20Intervals?preview=79166068)). The bad news is that there are conditions in which the two approaches do not give the same answers (see [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26450628/) and [here](https://psyarxiv.com/we9h6)), which are worth being aware of as you compute confidence intervals."

        "This approach requires understanding several concepts:\n",
        "\n",
        "a. Because of the Central Limit Theorem (Links to an external site.), the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal (Gaussian) distribution with large *n*; see [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/371067/trouble-relating-the-central-limit-theorem-to-confidence-intervals) and [here](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat506/lesson/1/1.4) for discussions of how this idea relates to confidence intervals.\n",
        "\n",
        "b. Accordingly, we assess the variability of the sampling distribution of the mean based on its standard deviation. This value is known as the standard error of the mean (SEM), which can be computed from the standard deviation (*s*) of the sampled distribution as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$SEM=\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\Sigma{(x-\\bar{x})^2}}{n}}$\n",
        "\n",
        "Notes: 1) don't [confuse *s* and the SEM](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3148365/), 2) possibly consider [Bessel's correction](https://www.statisticshowto.com/bessels-correction/) if you really care about getting a good estimate of $\\sigma$, and 3) use the known standard deviation ($\\sigma$) instead of the sampled value (*s*) if you have it.\n",
        "\n",
        "c. The SEM thus indicates the range of values that are within one standard deviation of the mean value of the sampling distribution of the mean, which corresponds to ~68% of all possible values:\n",

        "\n",
        "d. The confidence interval for an arbitrary confidence level can be computed by simply multiplying the SEM by a factor that corresponds to the appropriate range of the sampling distribution of the mean. This factor is known as the [z-score](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/z-score/) and represents the number of standard deviations that a value is from the mean of a distribution. It can be determined using a [z-score calculator](http://www.z-table.com), which relates the z-score to the area under the curve that is to the left of that z-score (i.e., the total probability that the value is less than that z-score):\n",

        "For a standard, two-sided confidence interval, the appropriate z-score is determined based on one-half of one minus the confidence level, because you want to find the area between two symmetric tails.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's say you want the 95% confidence interval (i.e., 0.95). Thus, you need to identify the z-score corresponding to an area equal to 0.5*(1â€“0.95) = 0.025, which is 1.96. Thus, the 95% confidence interval = $[\\bar{x}-SEM\\times 1.96, \\bar{x}+SEM\\times 1.96]$\n",
